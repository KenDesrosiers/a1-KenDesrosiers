## Technical Achievements
- **Used bootstrap framework**: I used the bootstrap framework in order to neaten up some of my storage of information. Bootstrap was very good to use because it has a lot of built in things that can save you a lot of time.

### Design Achievements
- **Organization**: I used a combination of html divs and css colors in order to separate my project into a top section for my introduction, and the bottom portion for my qualifications. I think this was a good design choice because it makes my project look a lot neater and more organized. Also, I put the courses and my experience into div that had the same background color as the top section, which compliments the bottom color very well.
- **Portability**: I made sure to not hard-code pixel values for the images to allow formatting across more than just my laptop resolution (making sure each image takes up about a third of the width of the screen). This is important because if this was not done the website would only appear well to screens of the same size as the developer, which is obviously a problem.
- **Modal**: I used bootstrap in order to store the course's information in modals. I think this was a good choice, because it is helpful information for people who do not know what these classes are, while not taking up major real estate on the webpage itself.
- **Image flipping**: I used CSS in order to neatly flip the amazing royalty-free images to show my experience with each of the skills. I think that having the reverse side have a transparent background looks very clean.
- **Sizing**: I used a jumbotron for the top section in order to space things better. This makes it so the content container takes up the entire width of the parent container (the screen size itself). This works just as well as the css property "width: 100%", but I wanted to make more use of bootstrap.
