## Technical Achievements
- **Used bootstrap framework**: I used the bootstrap framework in order to neaten up some of my storage of information.

### Design Achievements
- **Organization**: I used a combination of divs and css colors in order to separate my project into a top section for my introduction, and the bottom portion for my qualifications.
- **Portability**: I made sure to not hard-code pixel values in certain places to allow formatting across more than just my laptop resolution (ex: making sure each image takes up about a third of the width of the screen).
- **Modal**: I used bootstrap in order to store the course's information in modals.
- **Image flipping**: I used CSS in order to neatly flip the amazing royalty-free images to show my experience with each of the skills.
